Some information is just not suitable to be presented as logs and requires different visualisation. Good example are http calls performed by a server during processing of incoming request or events in a distributed system coming in undetermenistic order and duration.
Tohu can help transforming such information into format compatible with Chrome's about://tracing, which is awesome frontend for any traces and available almost everywhere alongside with Chrome.

#### Quickstart
- Install tohu
```bash
npm i tohu --save
```

- Include it in your sources
```javascript
const tohu = require('tohu');

// one eternity later
tohu.toFile('trace.json');
```

- View results with chrome tracing frontend
  - Open chrome://tracing in Google Chrome
  - Click "Load" at top left corner
  - Select trace file stored by tohu
